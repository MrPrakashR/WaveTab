## 🤔 About 

WaveTab is a `UITabBarController` that acts like a wave when moving between tabs. It works everywhere you'd expect it to, rotates, and scales according to device. It was inspired by a [plat4m](https://www.instagram.com/p/BtyXrgLjVkD/?igshid=8fsg1k1l0tt9) design. Please see below for a small screen recording of it in action.

## 🌊 Demo 

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## 📲 Installation 

WaveTab is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'WaveTab'
```

and run `pod install`

## ✅ Requirements 
- Swift 4.2
- iOS 10.0

## 👩‍💻 How to use

WaveTab can be used both programmatically and through storyboards. To use it programmatically, simply replace `UITabBarController` with `WaveTabBarController` and it'll handle the rest. For usage in storyboards, just set your class of the selected `UITabBarController` to be a `WaveTabBarController`.

If you inherit from the `WaveTabBarController` and call `func tabBar(_ tabBar: UITabBar, didSelect item: UITabBarItem)`, you must call to the `super` class.
